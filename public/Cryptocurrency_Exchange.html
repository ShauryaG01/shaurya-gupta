                The client wanted to build an end-to-end cryptocurrency exchange and stock investment platform. This
                platform was planned to help common investors gain access to top-of-the-line crypto investments.
                Besides, the platform even helped create and manage a
                variety of blockchain-based digital assets and stock investments. Delivering multiple investment
                opportunities, the platform has a dedicated wallet that can be used for different humanitarian and
                social causes. The client also wanted to
                build a platform that would support low transactional costs. Here are some highlighted business needs
                that the client had in mind before the engagement began.

                To help put its vision of a comprehensive and robust crypto exchange from paper to the real world, the
                client wanted to tie up with a blockchain development partner. Here is where we came in. Shaurya is a
                blockchain developer and have extensive experience
                in helping businesses build crypto exchanges from the ground up. Owing to this experience, we became the
                go-to option to help the client build a feature-packed crypto exchange. We brainstormed with the
                client's business leaders and technology
                teams to define the features that the exchange's users will have. We alongside the client, decided to
                give investors the option of buying and selling crypto-assets. Besides, we also empowered the users to
                transfer and withdraw their crypto-assets
                seamlessly. On top of that, we planned that the exchange should also have an escrow payment wallet of
                BTC, ETH, and other top-performing assets. Likewise, we even built an import crypto wallet for receiving
                different crypto-assets from
                a different wallet. Moreover, the process of creating wallets for storing crypto-assets was also planned
                to become much easier and faster. We even had dedicated user eKYC management systems to help minimize
                the threats of fraudulency.
                We also went with Kraken Exchange APIs for enabling real-time trading options. On top of that, we used
                Alpaca APIs to ensure real-time stock market investments took place. Our blockchain developers harnessed
                AngularJS, Node.js, and MongoDB
                for building the front-end, forming the backend, and managing all the database tasks.
                <br><br>

                <h4>Front-End</h4>Since the cryptocurrency exchange was supposed to attract hordes of investors, Shaurya
                makes sure the UI was interactive. That is why Shaurya used the latest
                components of HTML5/CSS and JavaScript.
                This way, our developers ensured that the UI had simplicity built right on the exchange's UI. Here are a
                few features that made the front-end of the project intuitive.

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Prioritized usability of the exchange over everything else</li>
                    <li>Ensured the UI's learning curve was not steep</li>
                    <li>Built dedicated windows for helping investors trade
                    </li>
                    <li>Streamlined the way sign-ups take place
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <br><br>
                <h4>Backend</h4>Our backend developers zeroed in on Node.js and Express.js to build a robust foundation
                for the application. Shaurya also used MongoDB as the database so that any transactional and data
                requests were handled optimally with
                zero downtime. Here are a couple of features for the application's backend.

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated Kraken Exchange APIs into the system for real-time crypto trading</li>
                    <li>Used Alpaca for simplifying how stock market investments take place</li>
                    <li>Leveraged Node.js and Express.js for developing APIs</li>
                    <li>Harnessed Accurascan for fast-tracking eKYC verification</li>
                    <li>Developed workflows to streamline and secure transactions
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br><br>
                <h4>Development Process</h4>We used the agile work methodology for accelerating cryptocurrency exchange
                development. In the beginning, we attended multiple pre-production meetings with the client to
                understand its requirements clearly. Once
                the deliverables were finalized, we worked in close collaboration with the client's business team and
                technology specialists. This way, we were able to fast-track project development. Here are the key
                highlights from the development process.

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Arranged pre-production meetings with the client to understand the scope of the project</li>
                    <li>Defined project milestones and got on sprint meetings periodically</li>
                    <li>Established the roles and responsibilities of project stakeholders as and when required</li>
                    <li>Handled any add-on requirements even while the development was afoot
                    </li>
                    <li>Tested different deliverables much before they were shown to the client</li>
                    <li>Extended post-deployment support to the client's team in the form of user training programs</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

                        Once the cryptocurrency exchange went live, the client attracted many investors. We helped the
                        client build a robust and all-inclusive fintech infrastructure. This infrastructure empowered
                        investors to uncover growth opportunities by helping the investors
                        speculate in crypto coins and multiple blockchain-powered assets. Here are some of the top
                        benefits that the project delivered once it was implemented.

                        <br><br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Empowered investors to operate and transact without any intermediary
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensured the speed of transactions was blazing fast even at peak hours
                            </li>
                            <li>Added fresh layers of security and scalability to the crypto-trading ecosystem</li>
                            <li>Implemented a fool-proof eKYC process for investors worldwide</li>
                        </ul>

                                scalability and security. I really appreciate working with Shaurya and will easily
