                The client sought to collaborate with a blockchain development partner to assist bring its vision of a full and robust crypto exchange from paper to reality. That's where we come in. Shaurya is a blockchain engineer with considerable expertise assisting
                businesses in the development of cryptocurrency exchanges from the bottom up. As a result of his experience, he became the go-to choice for assisting the client in developing a feature-rich crypto exchange. He collaborated with the client's
                business leaders and technical teams to identify the functionalities that exchange users will have. He decided, in collaboration with the client, to provide investors the option of purchasing and selling crypto-assets. In addition, Shaurya made
                it possible for customers to effortlessly transfer and withdraw their crypto-assets. Furthermore, he intended for the exchange to include an escrow payment wallet for BTC, ETH, and other top-performing assets. Similarly, he created an
                import crypto wallet to receive distinct crypto-assets from a separate wallet. Furthermore, the process of generating wallets for holding crypto-assets was intended to be simplified and accelerated. Shaurya had specialised user eKYC management
                tools in place to assist reduce the risk of fraud. Shaurya also used Kraken Exchange APIs to enable real-time trading. In addition, we leveraged Alpaca APIs to ensure real-time stock market investments occurred. Shaurya used AngularJS,
                Node.js, and MongoDB to construct the front-end, create the backend, and manage all database chores.
                <br><br>

                <h4>Front-End</h4>Since the cryptocurrency exchange was supposed to attract hordes of investors, Shaurya makes sure the UI was interactive. That is why Shaurya used the latest components of HTML5/CSS and JavaScript. This way, our developers
                ensured that the UI had simplicity built right on the exchange's UI. Here are a few features that made the front-end of the project intuitive.

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Prioritized usability of the exchange over everything else</li>
                    <li>Ensured the UI's learning curve was not steep</li>
                    <li>Built dedicated windows for helping investors trade
                    </li>
                    <li>Streamlined the way sign-ups take place
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <br><br>
                <h4>Backend</h4>Shaurya developers zeroed in on Node.js and Express.js to build a robust foundation for the application. He also used MongoDB as the database so that any transactional and data requests were handled optimally with zero downtime.
                Here are a couple of features for the application's backend.

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated Kraken Exchange APIs into the system for real-time crypto trading</li>
                    <li>Used Alpaca for simplifying how stock market investments take place</li>
                    <li>Leveraged Node.js and Express.js for developing APIs</li>

                <br><br>
                <h4>Development Process</h4>Shaurya used the agile work methodology for accelerating cryptocurrency exchange development. In the beginning,he attended multiple pre-production meetings with the client to understand its requirements clearly.
                Once the deliverables were finalized,Shaurya worked in close collaboration with the client's business team and technology specialists. This way, he was able to fast-track project development. Here are the key highlights from the development
                process.
