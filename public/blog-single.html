                    The client wanted to bring humor to the dry medical world. Because of this goal, the client wanted an interactive app that streamlined the way medical-related memes, funny videos and stories are created by the users. To realize the goal, the client brought
                    our team of hybrid app developers on board. The biggest challenge for our team was to build a one-of-its-kind app environment that made meme-creation for the medical field not only simple but also quick.
