                The app was designed with extensive dating functions. The programme was created to successfully
                coordinate with users while respecting their privacy, anonymity, and security. Shaurya worked to turn
                the client's concepts into matchmaking algorithms based on the user's preferences, hobbies, and actions.
                <br><br> Shaurya ensured that the users get their hands on a fantastic app which can be sued on
                mobile phones and laptops, tablets and other devices. The application was provided with feature
                adaptability functions to meet the evolving
                needs of the app users as per its growing popularity in the future.


                <br><br>
                <h4>Front-End</h4>The data was seamlessly organized for accessing from the backend server into the
                mobile application for seamless rendering. Users are provided a small time window within which they can
                correct their mistakes, like right swiping
                to signal liking while they actually wanted to swipe left to reject a match. The app features calendar
                for the users to plan a date, time and meeting place for in-person interaction. It was provided with an
                algorithm that fuels stickiness
                and encourages the users to stay on it for longer.

                <br><br> Other key features of the frontend include:

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>iOS: Swift 4, Core Data, InApp Purchase, Twilio, Socket Client</li>
                    <li>Android: Kotlin, Google Pay, Twilio, Socket.</li>
                    <li>Proximity limit and search with filters
                    </li>
                    <li>Payment gateway and administrative features
                    </li>
                    <li>One-on-one private messaging</li>
                    <li>Abuse reporting</li>
                    <li>Facebook/Google sign in</li>
                    <li>User settings and profile</li>

                </ul>

                <br><br>
                <h4>Backend</h4>Secure and powerful servers were set up that can handle databases with tons of personal
                information. Cryptography tools and encryption protocols were used in the backend development for added
                security. All development lifecycle
                plan was well documented that included technology, platform, timeline and other crucial information of
                the project development. A UX formula was adopted that made right swipe for Likes and left swipe for
                Dislikes as easy as playing a slot
                machine.

                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>PHP, Node JS, Mongo DB, MySQL, Apache, Socket</li>
                    <li>Big data based approach to behavior-based matchmaking</li>
                    <li>Admin panel to manage the mobile application</li>
                    <li>Accept and close support tickets, analytics and disputes resolution</li>
                    <li>Central authorization for the entire API for delivering maximum security</li>
                </ul>

                <br><br>
                <h4>Development Process</h4>Competitive and market research was conducted to understand the success
                potential of the app. Ideas were validated with the target audience through discussion on niche forums.
                Our developers worked out with the
                client to understand the math of love to create this dating app. A prototype of the app was showed to
                the client before the actual launch for them to assess the development and business requirements. The
                project was developed in 5 phases.
                <br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Matchmaking algorithm and monetization strategy</li>
                    <li>Right technology stack to make the app scalable, reliable and secure</li>
                    <li>Use of MVP app to minimize the risk and get the right direction from the start</li>
                    <li>Matchmaking algorithm with artificial intelligence for dating</li>

                </ul>

                        From my experience of developing matchmaking apps, we know that the application should be able
                        to do good matches else the people will use the platform less and less. A strong and secure
                        verification system was put in place with social media verification
                        to ensure that the person is what they say they are. The app was designed in sync with the
                        matching objective of the client and provided with features that encourage user engagement and
                        enhance their experience.

                        <br><br> The client had the below successful outcomes from their project:
                        <br><br>

                        <ul>
